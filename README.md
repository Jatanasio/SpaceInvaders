# Overview 

The game is a Space Invaders knockoff where players control a spaceship to shoot down incoming enemies. The game features multiple level with an increasing enemy count. Players can navigate their ship and fire bullets to eliminate enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen. The objective is to clear all enemy waves while avoiding collisions with them.

During this project, I was striving to improve my ability to code with classes, using an object-oriented style of programming.
